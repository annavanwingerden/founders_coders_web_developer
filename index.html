      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p class = "text-light">I work in early-stage startups, and have been very lucky to work closely with developers. </p>
      <p class= "text-light">In my last role, I was responsible for QA'ing all product releases.
        I learnt how to speak the language of devs - and how clear feedback could prevent bugs that would affect the user experience.</p>
        
        <p> In my current role, I've built a couple of streamlit web apps in python. 
        
        My first app was a quick protoype which was used in a demo, whilst my second was an internal
        tool which saves my team time on a weekly basis.</p>

            <p class = "text-light">I’m constantly impressed by how the the people I work with create products from lines of code. </p>
                
            <p class = "text-light"> I’d love to be able to do that and recently I’ve learnt how to. </p>

            <p class = "text-light"> I’ve tried to code in the past - but let fear get the better of me. In the last six months, I've learnt to throw all caution to the wind and just build stuff. </p>

            <h2>Why Founders and Coders</h2>
            <p class = "text-light">I believe that joining your program will accelerate my learning process for the following reasons:</p>
                <li>I know from experience that I learn best with others I can brainstorm with. I've loved being part of the Founders and Coders discord, and seeing what other people are learning.  My co-learners have helped me to explore new tools - for example, encouraging my exploration with APIs.</li>                
                <li>Slightly harder deadlines will benefit me. I’ve started many projects, but the number I’ve finished is significantly lower. </li>
                <li>From reviews and researching the career paths of Founders and Coders alumni - I know that it's a good programme and that it will help me to move into a more technical role. </li>
